The case-study revolves around the comprehensive process of raw data preprocessing in Python, specifically focusing on a dataset of employees that includes absenteeism reasons. The initial steps involve cleaning and transforming the raw data, making it suitable for machine learning applications. Following this, logistic regression is implemented for predictive modeling. Subsequently, an infrastructure is established to seamlessly connect Jupyter and MySQL Workbench, facilitating the integration of Python-based predictions with direct insertion into the database. To enhance the interpretability of the results, the case-study concludes with a visual representation and analysis of the findings using Tableau.
