The case-study contains raw data preprocessing in Python, preparing it for machine learning. The course covers the implementation and deployment of logistic regression, followed by the establishment of infrastructure connecting Jupyter and MySQL Workbench. This enables the prediction of values in Python and direct insertion into the database. The case-study concludes with visualization and interpretation of results in Tableau.
